# Days Gone AI Agent

This project implements an AI agent that can play the Days Gone game using computer vision and reinforcement learning techniques.

## Features

- Real-time game state capture
- Computer vision processing
- Keyboard input control
- Reinforcement learning model (to be implemented)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Days Gone game installed
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the agent:

```bash
python days_gone_agent.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the Days Gone game
2. Run the AI agent script
3. The agent will capture the game screen and attempt to play
4. Press 'q' to quit the agent

## Project Structure

- `days_gone_agent.py`: Main agent implementation
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Note

This is a work in progress. The current implementation includes basic screen capture and input control. The reinforcement learning model for decision making needs to be implemented.
